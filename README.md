# Detection-of-fabric-defects

This project involved the implementation of convolution neural networks to distinguish fabric defects according to different type of defects from different cameras.

### Neural Network Architecture
I developed a model based on that proposed by Gao et al. in "Woven Fabric Defect Detection Based on Convolutional Neural Network for Binary Classification". However this neuronal network has been adapted to a multi-class classification to evaluate when is "Good Fabrics" but also "Fabrics with needle defects" and "Fabrics with lycra defect".

This multi-layer convolution neural network is implemented to extract the most discriminating features and identify defective tissue images.
